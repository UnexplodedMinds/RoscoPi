INSTALLING RoscoPi

These installation instructions are only for installing RoscoPi itself.
You should already have a development environment set up on your
Raspberry Pi running the Stratux software.

You also need a working version of Qt installed on your Raspberry Pi.
At the time of this writing version 5.12.0 was current and what is currently used.
Earlier versions should work so if you want to save yourself some time and
frustration, check out the qtrpi project which I believe provides a fairly painless
way to get Qt 5.7 installed on your Raspberry Pi.

Getting a working version of Qt on your Rasperry Pi beyond the scope of this
document but it is doable, and you can save yourself a lot of time by setting up
to cross-compile it if you want to go that route.

Be sure to set up your display in portrait mode following the instructions
for whichever screen you have.  The Kuman 7-inch 800x480 capacitive touchscreen
was used for development, so in this case it was set up in 480x800 mode and the
touchscreen configuration was set to the rotation for that resolution.  The
instructions that come with that touchscreen are pretty clear and easy to follow.

BUILDING

1) Download the source into /home/pi/RoscoPi
2) cd /home/pi/RoscoPi
3) qmake RoscoPi.pro
4) make

SETTING UP TO AUT0-RUN

cd /home/pi/.config
mkdir autostart
cd autostart
nano RoscoPi.desktop

Add this to the file (assumes you're using lightdm):

[Desktop Entry]
Name=RoscoPi
Exec=/home/pi/RoscoPi/bin/RoscoPi
Type=Application
Encoding=UTF-8
Terminal=false
Categories=None;

Ctrl-X, then Y, then Return to save

Reboot:

sudo reboot

If you have a monitor or touchscreen attached you should see
an AHRS display.  Note that the software assumes you're running
the screen in portrait mode.  There is no option for landscape.
