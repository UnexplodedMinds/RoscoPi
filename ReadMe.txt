DO NOT RELY ON THIS APP FOR YOUR PRIMARY FLIGHT INSTRUMENTATION.

This app is meant solely as a backup and a convenient alternative
display of available traffic and attitude information available
from ADS-B through the Stratux ADS-B receiver with an AHRS daughter
board.

Most of the hard work is done by the Stratux itself and this app
is mostly a "dumb" display for that data.  It is not meant to replace
far more robust EFB apps.  It is meant to be used as a simple display
for the AHRS and available ADS-B data provided by the Stratux.  This
app has been modified from the Rosco Android app to run on a modest sized
screen connected directly to the Raspberry Pi HDMI port.

This app depends heavily on the Qt libraries, version 5.12.0 as of this
writing.
